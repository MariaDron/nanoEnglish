The jackal lived in a very untidy old house.
He didn’t want to clean or repair it. He was lazy and never took care of his house.
That is why the roof of his house had holes in it.
One day an elephant was walking past the jackal’s house. The elephant was very, very large and heavy. He tripped on the stone, fell right on top of jackal’s house and broke the roof. The jackal cried, «Oh, my house! It’s broken! What can I do ? Where will I live ?”
The elephant said, “I’m sorry for that! I’ll make a new strong roof for your house!” The elephant worked hard to make a new beautiful roof for the jackal’s house. But the jackal wasn’t happy. He thought, “The elephant is afraid of me! He said, he was sorry and he’s making a new roof now . So, he’s afraid of me! A huge elephant is afraid of me! I’ll tell him to make a new house for me!”
Soon the new roof was ready. The elephant wanted to go home but the jackal didn’t let him do it . He said, “Hey, you ! Do you think that a new roof is enough? No, it’s not enough ! I want a new house ! You must build a new house for me!” It wasn’t fair and the elephant was really angry with the jackal . He came to the jackal’s house and sat on it with all his huge heavy body. The house with its new beautiful roof was broken. The elephant didn’t say a word and left.
The jackal never understood why the elephant did so.
